DST architecture:
Do we prune once per period, then let weights regrow (sparsity is lost as inactive (0d, not really inactive) weights can become non zero)?
Or do we enforce a mask every iteration, and modify the mask every period?
    Do we prune then regrow a fraction of the mask?
        Do we regrow from inactive weights, or from inactive and pruned weights?

We noticed np and python is quite slow. Should we use TF for stuff then?

main.py not working without --no-log, monitor file handles flush thing

should we use the TFv2 or TFv1?
